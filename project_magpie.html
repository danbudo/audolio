      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>The Magpie was the last project I worked on before finally transitioning to Ableton Live from the Akai S2000. The theme was 60's exotica - but with a hint of menace to it. I didn't want it to be too easy, and I think these songs pretty much hit every target I was going for.</p>
      <p>Simon Jones provided the brilliant and complementary lyrics, vocal and guitar for "The Outsiders", which I feel could well be the best piece here. On reflection, its a shame that we didn't do more. The thing was, I had recently met Colin Webster and we had already began working on Chik Budo.. and that was a much more physical prospect.</p>
      <p>For some reason (at the time), standing next to a hi hat and rapidly getting tinnitus seemed strangely more appealing than sitting about in the studio listening to hours of records just to find *that perfect 3 second sample*.. but these tracks sound great as a mini collection, so it was definitely time well spent.</p>
